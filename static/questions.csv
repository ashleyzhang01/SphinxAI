quant," ""For a 3 sets tennis game, would you bet on it finishing in 2 sets or 3 sets?""","""Two sets - Let p=prob team 1 wins and q=prob team 2 wins. p^2 + q^2 = probability finish in two sets. 2*p*q = probability finish in three sets. p^2 + q^2 always >= 2*p*q, so the answer is two sets."""
quant,"""I have a square, and place three dots along the 4 edges at random. What is the probability that the dots lie on distinct edges?""","""3/8 - Given the edge the first dot is on, the probability the other two dots are on distinct edges is (3/4)*(2/4)"""
quant," ""How many digits are in 99 to the 99th power?""","""198 - 99^99 = (100)^(99) * (.99)^99 = (10)^(198) * (.99)^99. You can convince yourself 10^198 has 199 digits, and 0.99^.99 approaches 1/e. Thus, (10)^(198) * (.99)^99 has 198 digits."""
quant,"""2 blue and 2 red balls, in a box, no replacing. Guess the color of the ball, you receive a dollar if you are correct. What is the dollar amount you would pay to play this game?""","""17/6 dollars - You'll always get the last ball right as your sampling w/o replacement. The first ball you have a 50% chance of getting right. The second ball you have a 2/3 chance of getting right."""

quant,"""There are 5 balls, 3 red, and 2 black. What is the probability that a random ordering of the 5 balls does not have the 2 black balls next to each other?""","""0.6 - Because of repeats of black/red balls, there are 10 combinations of red/black balls: (5 choose 2) or (5 choose 3) spots to put the black or red balls, respectively. There are 4 places that 2 black balls can be next to each other, so the other 6 combinations do NOT have two black balls next to each other."""
quant,"""What is the least multiple of 15 whose digits consist only of 1's and 0's?""","""1110 - The last digit must be zero (30, 45, 60, 75, etc.). Multiples of 15 never end in 1. Then, starting checking numbers. 10, 100, 110, 1000, 1100, 1110. You will quickly arrive at the answer if you are good with your mental math."""

quant,"""If you look at a clock and the time is 12:15, what is the angle between the hour and the minute hand?""","""We know that at 12:15 the angle is slightly less than 90 (360/4). Now, the minute hand has only moved 1/4 of the way through the hour (the minute hand is at 15, which is 1/4 of the way around), so the hour hand has moved 7.5 degrees (30 degrees per hour times 1/4 move in the minute hand). Now we know the hour hand moved 7.5 degrees, so the answer is 82.5 degrees (90-7.5)."""
quant,"""You have a five-gallon jug and a three-gallon jug. Your must obtain exactly 4 gallons of water. How will you do it?""","""Fill the five-gallon jug and then pour it into the three-gallon jug. The five-gallon jug has 2 gallons left. Now throw the three-gallon water away. Pour the 2 gallons from the five-gallon jug to the three-gallon jug. So now the three-gallon jug has just 2 gallons of water. Fill the five-gallon jug again, and pour 1 gallon to the three-gallon jug. You are then left with 4 gallons of water in the five-gallon jug."""
quant,"""You are playing a card game against one opponent. The game starts with 21 cards on the table. You and your opponent alternate turns, and during each turn, A player may pick up 1, 2 or 3 cards. The winner is the person that picks up the last card. You go first. What is your first move, and what is the optimal strategy to win this game?""","""You pick 1 card first (leaving 20), then you want to respond to all opponent picks by picking a number that totals 4 combined with their last pick. So, you pick 1. Then, if they pick 3, you pick 1.if they pick 2, you pick 2.if they pick 1, you pick 3. This ensures that you're always leaving them with a multiple of 4 (first 20, then 16, 12, 8, 4), right until the end, when you leave them with exactly 4. When they're stuck with 4, they are out of luck, because regardless if they pick 1, 2 or 3, you will be able to win in the next turn."""
quant,"""A company has 10 machines that produce gold coins. One of the machines is producing coins that are a gram light each. How do you tell which machine is making the defective coins with only one weighing?""","""Every machine will have to produce a sample coin or coins, and you must weigh all these coins together.  How can you indicate which coins came from which machine? If every machine cranks out a different number of coins (machine 1 makes one coin, machine 2 makes two coins, and so on, then taking all the coins and weighing them together against their theoretical weight will give you the answer.  If you''re four grams short, for example, you'll know that machine 4 is defective."""
